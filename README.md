# In Search of Dharma

*A traceably-sourced research project and essay series that recovers **dharma** as the
universal human craft of building an ethical world to live inside — secular,
cross-cultural, and evidence-based.*

**In Search of Dharma** takes the word *dharma* away from the yoga studio and shows it
as something far larger: what every human group does when it assembles a way of
living — values, stories, practices — that *holds the group together*. There is no
single *The* Dharma. There are many, and they are **made, plural, and unprivileged**;
because they are made rather than found, we can — and now must — build new ones
consciously.

## Two-stage method

The project deliberately separates **gathering evidence** from **writing essays**:

- **Stage 1 — Research notes.** For each research question, one cited note whose every
  claim carries a source. The product is *traceable evidence*, not polished prose.
- **Stage 2 — Essays.** Eight essays and a preface, written *from* the notes. The prose
  names its sources in the open and hides the citation apparatus; each essay closes with
  a **Sources & further reading** list that preserves the chain back to the notes and
  their original works.

The point of the whole project — *traceable evidence behind every claim* — is meant to
survive the move from note to essay. The per-note recipe is in
[`METHODOLOGY.md`](METHODOLOGY.md).

## The essays

Read in order, the nine parts form one argument: a first-person search from *"what even
is a dharma?"* through real dharmas in the wild to *"can we build new ones on purpose?"*

| Part | Title |
|------|-------|
| 0 | [Preface](0-preface.md) |
| 1 | [Defining Dharma](1-defining-dharma.md) |
| 2 | [The Genesis of Dharmas](2-birth-of-dharma.md) |
| 3 | [The Dharmas of the Samin of Java](3-samin-of-java.md) |
| 4 | [A World of Dharmas](4-world-of-dharmas.md) |
| 5 | [How a Dharma Gets Under Your Skin](5-under-your-skin.md) |
| 6 | [When Dharmas Go Wrong](6-when-dharma-goes-wrong.md) |
| 7 | [Dharmas in a Secular Age](7-secular-age.md) |
| 8 | [Creating Dharmas](8-creating-dharmas.md) |

The series blueprint — the arc, the per-part briefs, and the status dashboard — is in
[`Essays.md`](Essays.md).

## The book

The nine parts are also assembled into a single book, *In Search of Dharma* —
subtitled *The human craft of building ethical worlds: a natural history of ethics in
eight essays* — built from [`cover.md`](cover.md) and the part files by
[`mk-book.sh`](mk-book.sh):

```bash
./mk-book.sh [epub|pdf|all] [--audio none|link|embed]   # defaults: all, none
```

The script preprocesses each part (frontmatter, image shortcodes), then stitches them
into an EPUB3 with pandoc and a PDF via weasyprint, with embedded fonts and optional
per-chapter audio narration (`link` adds hyperlinks to the hosted MP3s; `embed`
bundles them into the EPUB). The built EPUB and PDF are distributed via GitHub
Releases rather than tracked in the repository.

## Research notes

The evidence base is organised into eight categories, each a directory of cited notes:

1. [Foundational](1-foundational/) — etymology, universal patterns, boundaries, cognates
2. [Historical](2-historical/) — the Axial Age, urban complexity, pre-literate ethics, transmission, the lifecycle of a dharma
3. [Philosophical](3-philosophical/) — autonomy vs. collective, grounding, relativism
4. [Cultural](4-cultural/) — the Samin, Ubuntu, indigenous oral dharmas, Abrahamic frameworks, Subud and Sumarah, the Badui
5. [Psychological](5-psychological/) — neuroscience, evolution, moral development, ritual, psychopathy, neurodivergence
6. [Contemporary](6-contemporary/) — secular translation, the digital age, economics, gender
7. [Critical](7-critical/) — failure modes, appropriation, power, falsifiability
8. [Future](8-future/) — planetary dharma, AI, post-traditional dharmas, encoding ethics

The master question registry and status dashboard is [`Questions.md`](Questions.md); the
shared note structure is fixed by
[`1-foundational/_template.md`](1-foundational/_template.md). Every work cited across
the notes is resolved once in the citation register, [`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md).

◉ **Status.** Both stages are complete: all 44 research questions have their cited
notes, and all nine parts are written. The series is in final pre-publication polish,
so wording may still shift; the evidence base is stable.

## Contributing

Corrections — factual errors, broken citations, cross-essay inconsistencies — are the
most valuable contribution. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for what fits
